Sri Lankan media groups Thursday protested against the arrest of a reporter
close to Sarath Fonseka, the detained ex-army chief who tried to unseat the
president in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
The groups issued a joint statement demanding the release of Ruwan Weerakoon, a
reporter with the Nation newspaper, who was arrested this week.
</P>
<P>
"We request the Inspector General of Police to disclose the reasons behind the
arrest and detention of Ruwan Weerakoon and make arrangements for him to receive
legal aid immediately," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Weerakoon maintained close contact with Fonseka when the general led the
military during the final phase of last year's war against Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Fonseka was an ally of President Mahinda Rajapakse when the rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were crushed in May, but the two men later fell out
and contested the presidency in January's elections.
</P>
<P>
Fonseka was arrested soon after losing the poll and appeared in front of a court
martial this week. The case was adjourned.
</P>
<P>
Local and international rights groups have accused Rajapakse of cracking down on
dissent, a charge the government has denied.
