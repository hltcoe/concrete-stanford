<P>
Maker Communications Inc. which develops software that enables
engineers to create semiconductors essential to Internet
communications, has agreed to be acquired by Conexant Systems Inc.
for $942.8 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Conexant, of Newport Beach, Calif., will
pay $43.76 per Maker share, based on Conexant's closing price
Monday of $66 5/16. That works out to 0.66 shares of Conexant for
each Maker share.
</P>
<P>
The price is 28 percent higher than the Maker's 34 1/4 closing
price on Friday, the date both companies used in calculating the
value of the stock deal.
</P>
<P>
Maker's stock soared 7 1/2 points to close at 41 3/4. Conexant
shares dropped 3 5/16.
</P>
<P>
Maker, which went public in May, is little known outside the
semiconductor industry and is one of the few New England
chip-design software firms. Maker's software enables engineers to
create devices that process and switch data, voice and video in
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
The five-year-old Framingham, Mass. company's software is used
in communications systems, including switches and network access
products. The company's software enables customers to develop
high-speed, programmable, custom-designed chips for these and
devices that can help speed up the flow and delivery of information
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
For Conexant, which was spun off from Rockwell International
Corp. a year ago to focus on developing communications devices, the
pending acquisition of Maker is ``a strategic bullseye,'' said
Dwight W. Decker, Conexant's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
In a teleconference, William N. Giudice, Maker president and
chief executive, said no layoffs are planned, adding that company
plans to expand employment in Massachusetts from 80 people to 130
by the end of next year. Giudice will stay on as head of Framingham
operations.
</P>
<P>
Maker will be part of Conexant's network access division. The
Maker software will be marketed by Conexant's 250-person sales
force.
</P>
<P>
``With Conexant we can grow faster,'' said Giudice.
</P>
<P>
Both Conexant and Maker produce chips and software for customers
such as as Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Maker's incoming owners have ambitous plans for the
small software company. Decker said he expects to expand Maker's
business to reach annualized revenue of about $100 million by the
end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
That's a sizable gain. Maker earned $830,000 on revenues of $4.1
milliun in the third quarter. Net income for the first nine months
of 1999 was $1.3 million on sales of $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Conexant, whose sales doubled to $277.9 million in fiscal 1999
which ended in September, said the Maker deal will reduce its
profit by as much as one cent a share in fiscal 2000.
