</DATELINE>

<P>
She was precisely the kind of little girl I would have fallen madly
in love with, had I been 6 or 7 and not her grandfather. She was
skinny, with blond curly hair cut short, gangly when she ran,
restless with dull adult talk, a chatterbox herself, crazy for her
grandfather's stories, her two front teeth gone and paid for, not
nearly so shy of seeing worms for the first time that she would not
hold one.
</P>
<P>
In short, she was the perfect prospect for a fishing pal, and I had
known this for a long time and had laced my letters to her with
bluegill, trout, bass, hooks, bobbers. I tested a rod by asking her
to pull on the line. I was lousy with indirections, determined not to
force her, determined not to let the unintelligible jargon of fly
fishing wreck my plot, as I had let it spoil everything with her
three uncles.
</P>
<P>
I would have to wait six years for her 4-month-old brother, Tom, and
he might not like worms so well. So I was laying something of a
groundwork in the piscatorial direction, through innuendo and
cunning. I was no fool. I would not force anyone anymore. I was not
at all sure why we want those we love to love what we love but
forcing never helped.
</P>
<P>
``Of course you're forcing her,'' my shrewd daughter said. ``Don't
you see yourself at all, Dad? Leave my little girl alone.''
</P>
<P>
``Maybe she'll love fishing,'' I said quietly.
</P>
<P>
``It's a perfectly good thing to do, this fishing of yours, but some
people just don't like it, Dad _ and no one likes it as much as you
do,'' she said. ``That may be hard for you to imagine, but it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
``I have a gut feeling about your little girl,'' I said. ``She's
got...''
</P>
<P>
``Piscatorial potential,'' she said. ``I know. I know, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
But I backed away anyway and mentioned fish not at all over the
summer, until few weeks ago. The temperatures got up to 104 degrees
near Woodstock, N.Y., the creeks were dry, the nearest lake low, and
I knew I would have to make some dramatic moves or the season would
be over. At 70, you reckon the number of seasons left.
</P>
<P>
No flies this time. No rod for me, so I could not possibly rage
around rivers demonically possessed, fishing for 12 or 14 hours at a
time while my sons grew hopelessly bored, began to throw stones, and
their sister, Lara's mother, had to advise them: ``Be good _ or Dad
will put you in a story.'' No. The heyday of the blood, piscatorially
speaking, was over. No entomology this time; no 6X leaders; no cul de
canard winging; no big-name rivers with trout so snobby they sneered
at the poorly presented fly.
</P>
<P>
We began in my back yard with a rusted can, a shovel, and the hunt
for worms with each spade-full of earth turned. I remembered the
ritual well. If I was going to make a hunter-fisher-gatherer of my
granddaughter, the gathering was at least proving out. She had a good
eye, and a quick hand. We got six.
</P>
<P>
``Don't we want to get a few more, Grandpa?'' Lara said.
</P>
<P>
And so we got two more, small ones, and I rigged a spinning rod
without a reel, with line tied directly to the tip-top guide, to
which I affixed a bright red-and-white bobber, then a length of level
leader, then a smallish bait hook.
</P>
<P>
My friend Bill Kronenberg has a lovely spring-fed pond, an acre or
so, filled with outsized trout, plump bullheads and far too many
bluegill. The latter were always ravenous. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
There is a photograph of us, taken recently _ one old man, big as a
house, on a wooden dock, and a skinny little girl, in a long pink
cotton dress and sneakers and a floppy white hat. She is carrying a
gigantic creel over her shoulder and holding a long rod from which
dangles, unceremoniously, a pancake-sized bluegill, her first. The
old man has his arm around her waist so that she will not fall in.
The girl is serious about her first bluegill.
</P>
<P>
Lara's grandmother, who took the photograph, later reported that I
had clearly made a convert, though I remember reflecting soberly that
even our six bluegill _ and all the chattering about them afterward _
did not an angler make.
</P>
<P>
But the photo does give reason for hope.
