        <p>Correction of February 3 article about Mark Morris Dance Group general director Barry Alterman; group last performed in New York in March 2000; group's executive director Nancy Umanoff has master's degree in arts administration, not business administration (S)</p>

        <p>An article on Feb. 3 about Barry Alterman, general director of the Mark Morris Dance Group, misstated the date of the group's most recent performance in New York. It was last March, not in March 2000. The article also referred incorrectly to the credentials of Nancy Umanoff, the company's executive director, who took mild issue with Mr. Alterman about its financial perils. Her master's degree is in arts administration, not business administration.</p>
