NATATCHA ESTEBANEZ, 45; TAPPED HERITAGE TO MAKE FILMS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drawing deep from a reservoir of personal experience with family and
culture, Natatcha Estebanez set out in the mid-1990s to put
something very real about the Latino immigrant experience onto the
movie screen. "The Blue Diner," which she produced and co-wrote,
became an award-winning independent film six years later.
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 20 years, but I'm still Puerto Rican," she
said in an interview with NewEnglandFilm.com in 2001, the year
the film premiered. "This issue of identity, of who we
are, that's the core of 'The Blue Diner.' ... This
whole idea of the melting pot is no longer, to
me at least. I want to keep everything. I want
to keep it alive and keep it with me."
</P>
<P>
A producer, writer, and director, Ms. Estebanez won four New England
Emmy Awards for her work on "La Plaza," a series
on WGBH-TV about Latino culture, and more recently was series
producer for the children's show "Postcards From Buster." The National
Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Latino advocacy and
civil rights group, honored "The Blue Diner" in 2002 with
an ALMA award for outstanding independent motion picture.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Estebanez, who had survived Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer, died
Thursday of complications from a sarcoma that had metastasized. She
was 45 and lived in Belmont, Mass. with her husband,
Claudio Ragazzi, and their 8-year-old daughter, Gabriela.
</P>
<P>
"If you could see Natatcha, she has these liquid brown eyes,
dimples, an incredible wit, this mobile face where she's talking
and you can see everything she's thinking - just the
most expressive person," said Jeanne Jordan, a close friend and
editor for "Blue Diner."
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you notice about Natatcha is that she is
extraordinarily beautiful and absolutely lovely," said Brigid Sullivan, a vice
president at WGBH. "And then, when you get past that,
you see that she is also intelligent and deep and
filled with humor."
</P>
<P>
Ms. Estebanez, Jordan said, "was too congenitally modest to see herself
as a figure of admiration." For her, life had begun
inauspiciously.
</P>
<P>
"I was born and raised in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico," she
said in an interview with IdentityTheory.com. "I was on a
dairy farm that used to be a coffee plantation. ...
I grew up in the mountains, and I went to
rural schools and lived a rural life until I was
10 or 11 years old. At that time my mother
thought it would be a good idea to go to
San Juan, because education was not so great in Vega
Baja, and there were only so many cow stories she
could tell."
</P>
<P>
From San Juan she went to Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa.,
on a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
"I was the first Puerto Rican woman to attend," she told
IdentityTheory. "It was a culture shock, not to mention the
snow and all that."
</P>
<P>
Another scholarship sent her to London College for about three years.
She became ill with Hodgkin's disease and returned to the
United States for treatment. She finished a final undergraduate semester
at Muhlenberg College before going to the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, from which she received
a master's in visual communication.
</P>
<P>
Staying in Puerto Rico would have meant mostly producing commercials "with
beautiful boats and with women in bikinis, which I really
didn't want to do," she told IdentityTheory, so she began
working on documentaries and in television in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to "La Plaza" and "Postcards From Buster," Ms. Estebanez
produced dozens of documentaries and cultural programs about the Latino
communities and culture in the United States, according to WGBH,
where she had worked for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
She also produced and directed for PBS a dozen short films
as part of the Favorite Poem Project, four films for
The Discovery Channel, and worked on "Human Race," a PBS
series on race relations.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Estebanez was nominated for two national Emmy Awards for the
"Postcards From Buster" series, which drew the ire of the
US secretary of education for an episode in which Buster,
an animated bunny, learned about maple syrup at the Vermont
home of a lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
The day before Ms. Estebanez died, her husband - a composer
and musician - learned that he, too, had been nominated
for an Emmy for his work on the series. The
couple had met when he was performing at a dinner
for those involved with the "La Plaza" project.
</P>
<P>
"Natatcha Estebanez and Claudio Ragazzi are one of the great love
stories - the names alone," Jordan said. "They are so
beautiful and fell madly in love."
</P>
<P>
Ms. Estebanez, who had spent most of her career with nonfiction
projects, told IdentityTheory that in making "The Blue Diner" she
"found there is more truth in drama than there is
in documentary. ... Doing documentaries you have the illusion that
you are capturing reality. What you end up doing is
constructing your perception of what reality is - whatever that
might be."
</P>
<P>
To create "The Blue Diner" she had to traverse the emotional
landscape of what she called her own "turbulent relationship" with
her mother: "I had to search that. I had to
scratch. It had to hurt. And in that sense it
was more truthful."
</P>
<P>
Partway through production her mother died, and she worked with Jan
Egleson, her co-writer and the film's director, to focus more
on the mother-daughter relationship that is at the heart of
the story in the bilingual film. In the movie, a
Puerto Rican woman who speaks only Spanish lives in Boston
with her daughter. One day the daughter, who is bilingual,
suddenly loses her ability to speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
"Writing that part was like an exorcism," she told NewEnglandFilm.com. "The
writing allowed me to come to terms with the fighting
that went on between me and my mother."
</P>
<P>
"After her mother died, there was a moment when that character
really came alive and the connection really became unique and
personal for her," Egleson said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a true labor of love and deep, deep history"
for Ms. Estebanez, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Diner" played to three sold-out showings in Havana when
it was part of a film festival. And it was
the first film that Gabriela, then 2?, saw.
</P>
<P>
"I was trembling because I wanted her to like it. ...
It meant so much to me," Ms. Estebanez told IdentityTheory.
The film, she said, is "not unlike a painting or
a book, it has a life. ... It will be
there."
</P>
<P>
In addition to her husband and daughter, Ms. Estebanez leaves her
father, Eduardo of Spain; and her brother, Eduardo of Miami.
</P>
<P>
The funeral will be private.
