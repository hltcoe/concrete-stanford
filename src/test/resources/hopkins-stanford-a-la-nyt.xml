          In 1917, the laboratory was moved to its current location on
          Mussel/China/Cabrillo Point, and given its current name: Hopkins
          Marine Station of Stanford University. The marine station's namesake
          is Timothy Hopkins, the founder of the city of Palo Alto and an early
          supporter of Stanford University, not Johns Hopkins, founder of the
          Johns Hopkins University. The marine station is not affiliated with
          the latter.

          Johns Hopkins (May 19, 1795[2] – December 24, 1873) was an American
          entrepreneur, abolitionist and philanthropist of 19th-century
          Baltimore, Maryland.
          His bequests founded numerous institutions bearing his name, most notably
          Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins University (including its
          academic divisions such as Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Johns
          Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, and
          Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health).

          Amasa Leland Stanford[1] (March 9, 1824 – June 21, 1893) was an
          American tycoon, industrialist, politician and a co-founder (with his
          wife, Jane) of Stanford University. Migrating to California from New
          York at the time of the Gold Rush, he became a successful merchant and
          wholesaler, and continued to build his business empire. He served one
          two-year term as governor of California after his election in 1861,
          and later eight years as senator from the state. As president of
          Southern Pacific Railroad and, beginning in 1861, Central Pacific, he
          had tremendous power in the region and a lasting impact on California.
          He is widely considered a robber baron.
