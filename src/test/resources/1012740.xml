      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Washington scandal machine has now come full circle.</p>
        <p>The White House team that responds to rumor, innuendo and accusation -- labeled Masters of Disaster by one of its original members -- is itself the focus of a Senate committee investigating why so many lawyers are working at taxpayers' expense to defend President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The reason for all those lawyers, the White House says, is obvious. Seven Senate panels and more than half the House committees are conducting 31 separate inquiries of reported wrongdoing by Mr. Clinton, his Administration or the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>''It's like an arsonist complaining about the size of the fire department,'' James E. Kennedy, the White House scandal spokesman, said in an interview this week.</p>
        <p>Washington has become the center of a scandal-industrial complex, a multimillion-dollar enterprise employing a variety of professionals, including Congressional investigators, White House lawyers, private lawyers, private investigators, self-styled ethics watchdogs and journalists whose metier is uncovering, responding to or fending off scandal.</p>
        <p>The cost to taxpayers of supporting this network is considerable. The five independent counsels investigating current and former members of the Clinton Administration, including Kenneth W. Starr, have already spent more than $50 million. Congressional investigations have cost at least an additional $10 million.</p>
        <p>Rather than being a passing phenomenon of the Clinton years, some experts say, this scandal machine has become a permanent part of the capital's political architecture.</p>
        <p>''We've established enough organizations whose distinctive competence is investigating and publicizing scandalous allegations of various sorts,'' said Suzanne Garment, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a research group.</p>
        <p>Washington scandals have erupted with regularity over the years, and more frequently since Watergate, but never at the dizzying pace of the Clinton years. Mr. Clinton's Republican critics say the President's own behavior explains the phenomenon. But it seems nothing can account for the depth and breadth of the capital's scandal industry, where even peripheral political figures, like the wife of Speaker Newt Gingrich, retain lawyers for advice on Washington's maze of ethics rules and laws.</p>
        <p>With few big issues igniting the public or differentiating the two parties, political warfare in Washington is often focused on personal accusations of ethical wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>But as the culture and machinery of scandal have become more deeply ingrained in Washington, the public is showing signs of scandal fatigue. Polls show that most voters are not paying much attention to the current reports of sexual misconduct and cover-up involving Mr. Clinton. But this apathy has in no way slowed Washington's scandal machine.</p>
        <p>The Fire Wall  Separating Scandal From Business</p>
        <p>In 1995, after the Republicans took control of Congress, Harold M. Ickes, the former White House deputy chief of staff, moved to establish a separate unit to deal with questions over the Clintons' Whitewater land deal.</p>
        <p>''Instead of handling it ad hoc, he thought there ought to be an institutionalized response,'' said Mark Fabiani, a lawyer who was the unit's first spokesman. ''The idea was to keep these matters away from the day-to-day work of the White House.''</p>
        <p>The unit evolved into a permanent scandal-response group, moving from Whitewater to the campaign finance imbroglio to the accusations about the President's reported relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern.</p>
        <p>Only six lawyers are on the team, the White House said. Mr. Kennedy is the third person to serve as the unit's spokesman. A week before the Lewinsky controversy exploded, he arrived on the job after spending 17 years working for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and a brief stint with the credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>''I look forward to the day I can be laid off,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''when people like me don't need to be hired.''</p>
        <p>Actually, more people like him are being hired. Mr. Kennedy himself has an assistant.</p>
        <p>And Chris Lehane, who was formerly Mr. Fabiani's deputy, moved over to Vice President Al Gore's office in the fall of 1997, where he fields sticky questions about such subjects as campaign finance.</p>
        <p>The Inquiries  Going From Issues To Misdeed</p>
        <p>Until the 1970's, Congressional investigations were mostly focused on national issues like organized crime or unfair labor conditions, and the inquiring committees had few staff investigators.</p>
        <p>But in recent years Congress has become preoccupied with its own internal ethics investigations and the overlapping inquiries into reported misdeeds of the Clinton White House.</p>
        <p>''We're in this mode of permanent scandal,'' said Larry Gurwin, a Democratic staff investigator for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, who has also worked as an investigative reporter and a private investigator. ''It's almost like a Kabuki play that they've all acted a hundred times before and the audience has seen it hundreds of times before.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Senate and House both opened campaign finance investigations. The Senate Governmental Affairs panel, which spent $3.5 million on its inquiry, has just completed a six-volume final report weighing more than 17 pounds -- without transcripts or depositions, which will be added later. Most of the 75 lawyers and investigators hired for the Senate investigation are off the Government payroll, though some have found jobs in the House.</p>
        <p>With a $4.2 million budget, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, has sent investigators to Asia and has set up a $60,000 computer database for information culled from various Clinton investigations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton's chief investigator, David Bossie, is a relentless digger who earns more than $100,000. He is also a veteran of the Senate Whitewater inquiry.</p>
        <p>Richard D. Bennett, the committee's chief counsel, says the Burton investigation is focused on foreign money and will not duplicate the Senate's work. Mr. Bennett defends the need for the 30 lawyers and investigators working on the inquiry. ''We're not an adjunct of other investigations,'' said Mr. Bennett, whose Baltimore law firm receives $15,000 a month for his services.</p>
        <p>The spotlight will soon fall on David Schippers, a Chicago lawyer who is the House Judiciary Committee's chief investigative counsel. The panel would lead any impeachment inquiry that the House might open against Mr. Clinton after the independent counsel finishes his work.</p>
        <p>The scope of some investigations is small. Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, is demanding a full accounting of how much was spent on White House political events, including the cost to taxpayers of laundry for the overnight guests in the Lincoln Bedroom</p>
        <p>''We're not on a crusade here,'' said Ron Foreman, a spokesman for Mr. Kolbe, ''We are demanding some accountability.''</p>
        <p>Republicans, too, have felt the investigative heat. The Justice Department has been looking into the fund-raising of the former chairman of the Republican Party, Haley Barbour, and Mr. Gingrich faced a lengthy House ethics investigation that resulted in a $300,000 fine.</p>
        <p>The Specialists  Demand for Lawyers And Detectives</p>
        <p>All the overlapping investigations have created a bull market for a coterie of lawyers in Washington. Before Watergate, only a handful of lawyers, led by Edward Bennett Williams, specialized in defending political figures caught up in scandal. Now, virtually every major law firm has someone who handles these cases, and there is a group of small firms specializing in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's legal bills from two Washington firms already exceed $8  million. Robert S. Bennett, who is defending the President against Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit, has inherited Mr. Williams's mantle. But there are also many former Justice Department prosecutors who are prospering from defending clients.</p>
        <p>Nancy Luque is a former prosecutor representing Maria Hsia, who is charged with disguising illegal contributions by a California Buddhist temple to the Clinton-Gore campaign. Ms. Luque also represents Julie Hiatt Steele, a former friend of one of Mr. Clinton's accusers, Kathleen E. Willey. Ms. Luque describes her clients as ''bit players,'' but she has fielded interview requests from Barbara Walters and Maria Shriver.</p>
        <p>''It's a hungry machine that has to be fed,'' Ms. Luque said.</p>
        <p>Private investigators often work in tandem with the lawyers defending scandal figures, though their work is usually kept quiet. That changed with Terry Lenzner, an investigator whose firm, Investigative Group Inc., was hired in 1994 by Mr. Clinton's legal team. Last month Mr. Lenzner was subpoenaed to appear before the Whitewater grand jury meeting here because Mr. Starr wanted to know if Mr. Lenzner had been digging into the backgrounds of the counsel's staff members.</p>
        <p>A graduate of Exeter and Harvard, Mr. Lenzner is a veteran of the Senate Watergate investigation. (He handed President Richard M. Nixon a subpoena.) After practicing law, Mr. Lenzner founded his group 14 years ago. The firm has nine offices in this country and abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lenzner, who says that only a small part of his business involves political figures, said that in the world of corporate takeovers, private investigators were an established part of any team. ''The perception of guys in raincoats with their feet on the desk in dusty backrooms is outmoded,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Until the use of private investigators by the Clinton campaign in 1992 became known, they were not an established part of the political world. Now, not only Mr. Clinton uses them, but also many political candidates -- sometimes to investigate their own backgrounds in order to anticipate attacks from opponents. Ms. Jones's legal team employed two detective agencies.</p>
        <p>The Scandal Stirrers  Private Groups Pursue Lawsuits</p>
        <p>While Government investigations have increased, lawsuits by private groups are also used as a tool to further scandal. In the Clinton years, these suits have been filed or supported by a number of conservative organizations.</p>
        <p>The most nettlesome for Mr. Clinton have been the Rutherford Institute, which has paid some of Ms. Jones's legal fees, and Judicial Watch, a group founded by a Washington lawyer, Larry Klayman, who calls himself a ''conservative Ralph Nader.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, Judicial Watch gained attention by suing the Commerce Department for withholding information about United States trade missions abroad, led by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, that included Democratic contributors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klayman has four lawsuits pending against the department. Judicial Watch has also filed a class-action lawsuit against the Clinton Administration on behalf of former Republican appointees who accuse the White House of improperly obtaining files the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintained on them for security purposes.</p>
        <p>''We're able to do things Ken Starr can't,'' said Mr. Klayman, who sees his efforts as complementing Mr. Starr's criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>The Echo Chamber  Putting Legs On the Unsavory</p>
        <p>Without the attention of news organizations, no Washington scandal can endure.</p>
        <p>Even after the dismissal of the suit against Mr. Clinton and with the pace of Mr. Starr's investigation slowing, the inquiry surrounding Ms. Lewinsky is still prime-time fodder for news, especially on the three 24-hour cable networks, whose ratings soared in the early days of Mr. Starr's investigation into the reports of her relationship with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Many news organizations have expanded their investigative reporting staffs to cover the inquiry, and one cable network, MSNBC, often fills its prime-time lineup with stories on the Lewinsky case.</p>
        <p>Watching all this from a distance is Mr. Fabiani, who moved to California two years ago and now counsels businesses on how to deal with public relations problems. ''When you get back to the real world, you find out how little people care about that stuff,'' Mr. Fabiani said. Nevertheless, he named his firm MOD, in fond memory of the Masters of Disaster.</p>
